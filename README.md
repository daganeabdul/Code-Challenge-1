  Description

This project is a collection of simple JavaScript programs that solve everyday problems in a Kenyan context. It includes interactive estimators for:

Kenyan Chai Calculator – Determines the ingredients needed for a given number of chai cups.
 Boda Boda Fare Estimator – Calculates the fare based on trip distance.
 Transaction Fee Estimator – Estimates the fee for sending money based on common mobile transaction rules.

Each program uses basic JavaScript concepts like `prompt()`, functions, conditionals, and `console.log()` to interact with the user.
